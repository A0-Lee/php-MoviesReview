SETTING UP MOVIE REVIEW WEBSITE:
NOTE: Before following the insructions below, 
this assumes that XAMPP version 7.3.12 or lower has already been installed and the file paths are known to you.

1) Use the default MySQL values (should be set automatically by default if untouched) for the MySQL Module settings:
	User: root
	Password:
	(means no password!)

2) Start the MySQL Module in XAMPP via Control Panel

3) Import moviesReview_database.sql using phpMyAdmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/server_import.php

4) Unzip folder moviesReview_website.zip (containing .php and .ico files) into ...xampp\htdocs

5) Start the Apache Module in XAMPP via Control Panel

6) Go to http://localhost/moviereview.php and enjoy the website!
